# Samuel Hepner's bitcoin prediction app
It is deployed [here](https://bitcoin-predictor.herokuapp.com/)

## About the app
I used a dash template to upload my plotly visualizations and building the web app

## Does this app predict future prices?
No. Unfortunately, it does not. I made this when I was just starting out with data science.  
I trained on years before 2018, validated on years 2016 and 2017, tested on all years.

## Where can I find your data science code?
You can find my jupyter notebook [here](assignment_applied_modeling_1,2,3,&4.ipynb)
